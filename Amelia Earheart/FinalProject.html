        <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Amelia Earheart was an American aviator who mysteriously disappeared while trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator. She was the 16th woman to be issued a pilot's license. She was the first women to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and the first person to fly over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Earhart was legally declared dead in 1939.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Innovation</h3>
            <p>There weren't many female pilots back then, and her actions inspired other women to follow their dreams. This was especially important because there were few career choices available to women at that time. Amelia Earhart has inspired generations of women to do things that had never been done by women before. </p>
